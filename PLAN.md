# Gratitude journal

This is intended to be a simple gratitude journal, to allow writing down a few things to be grateful for each day, and to bring up a random selection on demand. It will be written as aweb SPA.

### MVP (absolutely minimal)

- display 3 random entries at top of page (including dates)
- prompt to enter a gratitude entry
- once one entry made, prompt for another, up to max of 5 per day

- data stored in browser (thin abstraction over storage because next stage will be remote storage)
